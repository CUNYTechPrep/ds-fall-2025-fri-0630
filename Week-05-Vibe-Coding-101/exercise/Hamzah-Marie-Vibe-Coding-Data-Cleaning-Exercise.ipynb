    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",

    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",

    "- Missing and invalid entries\n",
    "- Requires business judgment calls\n",

    "## Your Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "## Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summarize your findings here:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Median salary for Software Engineers in US:** $105,000  \n",
    "2. **Highest paying US state for tech:** California ($128,000 average)  \n",
    "3. **Salary increase per year of experience:** $2,900 per year  \n",
    "4. **Remote vs office percentage:** 38% remote, 62% in-office  \n",
    "5. **Highest paying non-tech industry:** Finance and Banking ($115,000 median)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- Tech salaries cluster heavily on the coasts (CA, WA, NY) with a strong remote contingent.  \n",
    "- Experience steadily raises pay, but growth flattens after ~20 years.  \n",
    "- Gender and education gaps persist: men earn slightly more, and master’s holders have a modest premium.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges faced:**\n",
    "- Dataset had messy column names → solved with flexible keyword matching in Pandas.  \n",
    "- Multiple currencies and countries → filtered strictly to USD + U.S. respondents for consistency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learned about vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real-world data cleaning means constant detective work—no perfectly labeled columns.  \n",
    "- Writing modular code (clean → analyze → visualize) keeps debugging painless.  \n",
    "- The “vibe” is iterative: explore, test assumptions, adjust, and rerun until the insights feel trustworthy.\n"
